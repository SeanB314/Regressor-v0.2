# Regressor-v0.2
An unfinished text adventure in python inspired by the idea of a "regressor"

This project was an attempt to write a text adventure game in python. I wanted to create a game with an interesting twist, and I was inspired by stories I had read of characters who are "regressors," meaning that when they die, the world resets around them and they must begin again with all their memories. I wanted to see if I could implement a recursive story like that with code, and also create a choose-your-own-adventure style branching narrative based on the choices of the player. I also was trying to learn and apply the basics of object-oriented programming.

This led to some interesting problems. The most difficult to solve was how to create a system that would keep track of the narrative, reset and begin again if the player dies, and give the user the option to quit at any time simultaneously. I was eventually able to find a system that worked.
